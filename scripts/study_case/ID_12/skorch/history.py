class History(list):
    """History contains the information about the training history of
    a :class:`.NeuralNet`, facilitating some of the more common tasks
    that are occur during training.

    When you want to log certain information during training (say, a
    particular score or the norm of the gradients), you should write
    them to the net's history object.

    It is basically a list of dicts for each epoch, that, again,
    contains a list of dicts for each batch. For convenience, it has
    enhanced slicing notation and some methods to write new items.

    To access items from history, you may pass a tuple of up to four
    items:

      1. Slices along the epochs.
      2. Selects columns from history epochs, may be a single one or a
         tuple of column names.
      3. Slices along the batches.
      4. Selects columns from history batchs, may be a single one or a
         tuple of column names.

    You may use a combination of the four items.

    If you select columns that are not present in all epochs/batches,
    only those epochs/batches are chosen that contain said columns. If
    this set is empty, a ``KeyError`` is raised.
