    "# Simple Image Classifier Using Tensorflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will create an image classifier with Tensorflow that will be able to classify images of your choice. This example utilizes the [Inception v3](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/inception) architecure model. Inception is a pretrained [convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) model trained on over a hundred thousand of [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) images, classifying them into 1000 categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get the model to be able to identify a custom image, we must apply [transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning). This is where we apply the learning from a previous training session to a new training session.\n",
    "\n",
    "The magic of transfer learning is that lower layers that have been trained to distinguish between some objects can be reused for many recognition tasks without any alteration."

    "The ***bottleneck_dir*** will be used to cache the outputs of the lower layers on disk so they donâ€™t have to repeatedly be recalculated. 'Bottleneck' is an informal term often used for the layer just before the final output layer that actually does the classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will run this example for 1000 iterations. This amount can be experimented as the improvement in accuracy has diminishing returns the longer you train for.\n",
