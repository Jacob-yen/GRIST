# CNN-RelationExtraction
Convolution neural network for relation classification between two given entities

 The CNN architecture implemented is inspired be Nguyen et al. 2015 in which for each:

<!--##Future work: -->

<!--- Implementing additional crafted features to `vectorizers/relationmentionvectorizer.py` such as pos tags and dependency relations. -->
<!--- Implementing sentence based features : in which additional sentence based features are added including two head words to find relations between them  -->
